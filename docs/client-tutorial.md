** Step 1: Initialization
Download [https://github.com/angular/angular-seed][Angular Seed] project to use as a base.  I'm not totally in love with their organization but it is probably the most commonly used folder structure in the Angular world.  So for now we'll stick with it.

** Step 2: Cleanup
Made simple index.html file for single view.
Added basic bootstrap css and fonts.
Removed sample controllers, directives, filters, and services.
Added controller stubs we will actually use.
Added very basic partial templates for the 3 main app operations: list all, view one, view version.
