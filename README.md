A work-in-progress tutorial that explores functional programming techniques and technologies to build modern, mobile webb-applications using JavaScript and a Haskell-powered RESTful JSON API. 

## Overview of technologies

### Functional programming

As a form of declarative programming, code written in functional style carries no immediate sense of sequentiality. This makes it particularly well-suited for parallel and asynchronous programming.

Another key difference is that the function, as one could expect, has a much more central role. Functional programming languages treat functions as first-class values. They can be passed around as arguments, and used in declarations, similar to class-type objects in OOP.

### Haskell

Haskell is a modern, compiled, strongly typed, purely functional, programming language based on the (Girard-Reynolds) polymorphic lambda calculus, also known as System-F. The Haskell language standard is the result of over twenty years of research in programming language design.

GHC is the most commonly used Haskell compiler. It comes bundled with the Haskell platform -- a development environment available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Haskell belongs to a language family commonly referred to as lazy functional programming languages. Lazy evaluation is a technique used by compilers to implement a language property known as non-strictness. Strict and non-strict semantics differ in how evaluation of expressions propagates:

* In the more common, strict semantics, expressions are evaluated from the inside-out. (example)
* Non-strict semantics starts from the outside and unfolds towards the center. Sub-expressions are only evaluated when they are needed (call-by-need).

### JavaScript

### JSON

### REST


## Part I. Server

### Happstack

### Language extensions

#### FlexibleContexts

#### Template Haskell

#### OverloadedStrings

#### RecordWildCards

...

The RecordWildCards extension introduces a simple notation that makes pattern matching over records a bit less verbose, in cases where many fields are involved.

### HaskellDB

HaskellDB is a combinator library for building syntactically correct, type-safe database queries, similar to the Language Integrated Query (LINQ) component in the .NET framework.

As an example, here is what a simple query can look like using HaskellDB:

    getContent = do
      content <- table T.content
      project $ F.id << content!F.id
  

The original HaskellDB library was written by Daan Leijen and Erik Meijer (who is also the architect behind LINQ). It draws heavily from concepts in relational algebra, and the theory behind HaskellDB is described in Leijen's PhD thesis: “The λ Abroad - A Functional Approach to Software Components.” Fortunately, understanding HaskellDB does not require deep knowledge in relational algebra, which serves in this context as a theoretical foundation for relational databases.

#### The new HaskellDB

The first version of HaskellDB was relying on a feature called TRex – Typed records with extensibility – only available in the Hugs interpreter. Additionally, it only supported a Windows-specific ADO-based database backend. To address these, among other issues, a more recent, more portable version of the library was developed by students at Chalmers University of Technology.

##### Connecting

We will be using SQLite in this tutorial. To connect to the database we define a `withDB` function, as described in the Chalmers paper:

    withDB :: (Database -> IO a) -> IO a
    withDB = hdbcConnect generator (connectSqlite3 "db.sqlite")

##### Preparing the tables

##### Querying

HaskellDB defines a Query monad, and queries are expressed using native Haskell functions.

### Aeson

In Greek mythology, Aeson was the father of Jason. In Haskell folklore, Aeson is a JSON parsing and generation library optimized for ease of use and high performance.

#### Creating a simple JSON type

##### ToJSON

##### FromJSON

### Resources

### Routes

### Types

### Models

### Controllers
